## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow established coding conventions and best practices
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality
- Document complex logic and architectural decisions

### Collaboration Workflow
- Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format
- Create focused pull requests with clear descriptions
- Review code thoroughly and provide constructive feedback
- Update documentation when making significant changes
- Communicate effectively with team members about design decisions

### Documentation Requirements
- Maintain up-to-date README files with setup and usage instructions
- Document API endpoints, function signatures, and data structures
- Keep inline comments focused on "why" rather than "what"
- Update architecture diagrams when system design changes
- Provide examples and use cases for complex features

### Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for all business logic
- Write integration tests for critical user flows
- Maintain test coverage above 80% for new code
- Use meaningful test names that describe expected behavior
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Security Considerations
- Follow security best practices for the technology stack
- Validate all user inputs and sanitize data appropriately
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Keep dependencies up to date and scan for vulnerabilities
- Handle sensitive data with appropriate encryption and access controls

### Performance Guidelines
- Profile application performance regularly
- Optimize database queries and data access patterns
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks
- Consider scalability requirements in design decisions

## AI Agent Instructions

When working on this project, please:

1. **Understand the Context**: Always review existing code and documentation before making changes
2. **Follow Patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing code patterns and architectural decisions
3. **Think Incrementally**: Break large changes into smaller, reviewable commits
4. **Validate Changes**: Run tests and verify functionality before submitting code
5. **Communicate Clearly**: Explain your reasoning for design decisions and trade-offs

{{EXTRA_RULES}}

These guidelines help ensure code quality, maintainability, and effective collaboration across all development tools and AI assistants.
